    <p>AI is notorious for adding a couple fingers on human hands because of their complicated structure. KFC used this to go along with their slogan, "The more fingers you have... the more you can lick".</p>

    <p>They continued to show their love for AI art by generating more and more ads, affectivley replacimg their designers and artists with a machine.</p>

    <p>KFC ads have only gotten worse, lacking the originality and emotion that draws people in. No longer does the food look good, just silly and nonsensical. Instead, KFC continues to use generated works to represent their bran, creating a more robotic and fake atmosphere, rather than the former homey and warm one.

    <p>This is where the images become creepy. While this was supposed to be celebrating Thanksgiving, the art style is so realistic in an uncanny valley way that it can only creep you out. Its style is also extremely inconsistent, showing the laziness and lack of passion that comes with ai</p>
    <p>What makes this worse is that there is a already a painting of this scene by Norman Rockwell, which is significantly better </p>

            <p>Heinz did a series of ads in which they depicted their bottle of ketchup through multiple generated AI images. "This is what AI sees". It's supposed to be a way to boost their brand, however, it just makes them look silly and cheap. Instead of hiring artists and designers to create more clever ads, they use AI to create weird and unnecessary images. The bottle label isn't even spelled correctly either. Instead of being professional, it comes off as a beginners photoshop project with 0 effort put into it.</p>

                <p>Before AI, Heinz used to be much more clever with their ads. They would create scenes, or in this case, use the shape of the bottle to look like something else and connect it back to their brand. Unfortunately, this is no longer done by the company.</p>
